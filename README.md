#Introduction

This small project is written for ammonite. The extension `.sc` is used to get code completion working smoothly in intellij. The point of the project is to be able to take csv data and easily insert it into a database. Sometimes databases support operation to import csv data, but this data should then reside on the same server as the database, which isn't very convenient if you for example are running your database in docker.

# Requirements

* Ammonite (https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite)[Ammonite] with its requirements.
